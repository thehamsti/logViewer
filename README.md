- **React** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Bundler and dev server
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **shadcn/ui** - For beautiful, accessible components

2. Creates a new release
3. Uploads the built artifacts
4. Generates update manifests

## Development Setup

```bash
deno install
